## Dragon's Ascent üêâ

> Dragon's Ascent is a third-person obstacle course game built in Unreal Engine 5. As the warrior Kwang, you must ascend a mystical temple mountain, collecting Money Toad relics. The path is treacherous, and a single misstep will send you tumbling back to the beginning to start your climb anew. ‚õ∞Ô∏è

This project was developed as a comprehensive exercise in Unreal Engine 5, combining both C++ and Blueprints to create a complete gameplay loop.
